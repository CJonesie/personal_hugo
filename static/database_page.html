                <h1>Databases</h1>
                <p class="major">Database are a crucial part of most large programs and apps. An understanding of how to design, implement, and work with them is
                    an important skill that all developers should have.
                </p>
                <p>I have had experiance using <strong>SQL</strong> databases such as Postgres, MySQL, and Oracle
                     I have had the oppertunity to work on real world applications that rely heavily on SQL database and
                     have learned the importance of database design. I have worked with <strong>MongoDB</strong> on multip projects. MongoDB is a "NoSQL" database
                     this can be a great option in scenarios where a relational style databse isnt getting the job done.</p>
