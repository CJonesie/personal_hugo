                <h1>My Python Projects</h1>
                <p class="major">Python is a powerful language that gets used in varying types of projects. It is the first programming language that I learned.</p>
                <p>I have worked on multiple <strong>Python</strong> projects. I have worked on small programming challenges like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conways Game of Life</a>,
                    I have worked on larger projects and even full <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> web apps. I have also been exploring the machine learning capabilities that Python holds.
                    Python is a language that has so much applications and potential and it is a language that I love working with.</p>
